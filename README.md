# React + Express App

This project is a full-stack application that consists of a React frontend and an Express backend.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

#### Backend (Express)
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project.
2. Run the following command to install the necessary Node packages:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

#### Frontend (React)
1. Open a second terminal and navigate into the `client` directory:
   ```sh
   cd client
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### 2. Building the React Application
Whenever you make changes to the frontend, you need to build the React app:
1. In the terminal inside the `client` directory, run:
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

### 3. Running the Application Locally
1. In the terminal at the root directory, start the backend server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
2. The application should now be running locally.

## Notes
- Ensure both the backend and frontend dependencies are installed before starting the application.
- Running `npm run build` in the `client` folder compiles the frontend assets before serving them.

Enjoy coding! ðŸš€
